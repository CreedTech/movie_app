A responsive mobile application that doesn’t pixel out on various mobiles of different densities and resolutions. Since, the design that I have in hand is for Mobile Portrait, hence this app will not support landscape and web versions. That means, this app can run on landscape mode and browser, but will render its components in a bad way.

Having said that, if you need to learn landscape and web version of this application, do let me know and I will try to create a design that works on landscape and web.

So, Let’s get started.

## How it's build?

Developing apps in Flutter gives you free hand to choose the architecture and libraries. With so many options in your hand you’ll often donate a lot of your time in selecting a specific architecture. Most popular and trustworthy architecture is Clean architecture, where you’ve separate layers for Presentation, Domain and Data.

That’s why, I will also teach you how to build application using Clean architecture.

Let’s create some folders and files. First, you’ll go to terminal and run the command

This will create an empty Flutter project with **lib** folder.
